# Lox
This repo is my implementation of the interpreted language `lox` from https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html.  
The official book that teaches implementing `lox` is written for Java and C. I plan to write both, but with the Java version in C# instead. 

### cslox
The C# implmentation.  Still in progress.

### clox
The C implementation. Not yet started.
